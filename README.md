Hello everyone,

This is the first ever project i made with React & Tailwind. It looks like a mess there is a lot of repeatable code from tailwind,
as i never learned it and tryed to use it with my css knowledge if something was not known i whould use their official website to look up commands, it was fun to work on.
There was a lot of strugling to the point of showering to get rid of the sweat but i pushed through and made it. I'm super happy!

This website should be optimized to work on Desktop and Mobile, it was verry hard to work with bad px images so it does not work on tablet sadly.
I'm going to continue working hard and keep making things i can in hopes to one day get junior web dev job before its too late! :)
